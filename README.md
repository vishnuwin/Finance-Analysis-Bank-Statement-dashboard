- How does the balance change across months?

## Data Cleaning & Preparation
During preprocessing, some transformations were applied for clarity and analytical convenience:

The original Description field, which contained mixed or unstructured text, was converted into a standardized Category column.
This allows transactions to be grouped clearly under categories such as Salary, Rent, Utilities, Groceries, etc.
The Date field was simplified into a Month column (Jan, Feb, Mar…).
This makes monthly grouping, summaries, and trend analysis much easier.
These transformations were done to improve the consistency, readability, and usability of the dataset for financial analysis.
